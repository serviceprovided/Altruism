										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several women complained of harassment against him. When he was elected governor of California, six women accused him of harassment. However, Arnold Schwarzenegger has always claimed to be &#8216;innocent&#8217;. But after two decades, the actor apologized for misbehaving with women. Not only that, he opened up about his &#8216;secret&#8217; child. News People.com, CNN</p>
<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger&#8217;s documentary &#8216;Arnold&#8217; will be released on OTT platform Netflix. There, the &#8216;Terminator&#8217; actor made an &#8216;explosive&#8217; confession about his life.</p>
<p>Regarding misbehavior towards women, he said, &#8216;My reaction is defensive. Now when I look back, I think what I did was wrong.&#8217;<br />
In this documentary, Schwarzenegger talks about the child of his housekeeper. He told how he told his wife about his &#8216;secret&#8217; child.</p>
<p>Schwarzenegger married Maria Shriver in 1986. They were married for more than three decades before their separation in 2021. They have four children in their family. While married to Shriver, Schwarzenegger had an affair with housekeeper Mildred Bena in 1996. They also had a son named Joseph Bena.</p>
<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger and Shriver have long sought counseling for marital discord. At that time, Schwarzenegger had to face difficult questions from his wife about having a child with a housekeeper.</p>
<p>When the counselor wanted to know on behalf of Maria, whether Joseph was her child or not, Schwarzenegger felt like his heart was going to stop. Then he told the truth.</p>
<p>Schwarzenegger said about that incident, &#8216;I had a relationship with him in 1996. At first I didn&#8217;t realize Joseph was my child. But as he grew up, it became clear. Then it became my concern, how can I keep it a secret?&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After an underwhelming season, the Denver Broncos will look to flip the script in 2023. Here are three players who have to take the next step.</p>
<p>The Denver Broncos seemed primed to be title contenders last season. They boasted one of the best defenses in the NFL. They had a wealth of offensive weapons in Javonte Williams, Melvin Gordon III, Jerry Jeudy, Courtland Sutton, and Tim Patrick. All they were missing was a quarterback, and they made a massive move by trading for 9-time Pro Bowl quarterback Russell Wilson.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Broncos fell very short of expectations, posting a 5-12 record. Injuries, coaching, and an underwhelming season from Wilson were all contributing factors.</p>
<p>After a busy offseason, the Broncos will look to bounce back and live up to their potential. Here are three players that they need to take the next step.</p>
<p>Broncos who have to take the next step this season: 3. WR KJ Hamler<br />
Since being selected in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft, Hamler has had an unfortunate run of injuries. He ended his rookie season on the IR due to a hamstring injury. In 2021, he suffered an ACL tear in Week 3, which sidelined him for the rest of the season. In 2022, he, once again, suffered a season-ending hamstring injury.</p>
<p>In March, Hamler underwent surgery for a partially torn pectoral muscle. He could potentially return to the field in late July, per NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero.</p>
<p>On the field, Hamler is an explosive deep threat. Last season, he averaged a whopping 23.6 yards per reception in limited action. His elite speed allows him to cruise past defensive backs downfield.</p>
<p>The Broncos offense needs a spark, as they finished last in the NFL in points per game last season (16.9). A healthy Hamler could make a big impact for the team.</p>
