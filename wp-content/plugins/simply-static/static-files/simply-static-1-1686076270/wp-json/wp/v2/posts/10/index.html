So I gave up. The time is 2019.<\/p>\n<p>Julia the Virgin. His son gave up smoking. To help others overcome this addiction, he shared his experience with the German media Deutsche Welle.<\/p>\n<p>Julia said, &#8216;I quit smoking for two months. Never took it again. Dr. Tobias Ruther was thrilled that I had quit smoking. He heads the specialty outpatient clinic for tobacco addiction treatment at the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Doctor Tobias told Julia, &#8216;When you quit smoking, you will see many positive things happen in your life.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>A lot of things will change soon<br \/>\nEight hours after you quit smoking, your body will take in a lot more oxygen, Tobias said. After a day or two, many smell and taste as before. After two weeks, lung function also increases, especially during sports.<\/p>\n<p>After giving up smoking, Julia said that she feels as fit as ever.<br \/>\n&#8216;After quitting smoking, you may have a lot of phlegm, which was not the case before,&#8217; says Tobias. This means that your lungs are clearing them out on their own. It may take up to a month to fully clear. And after this one month your immunity will increase a lot. When you read like this in three months, you will sleep well at night. Smokers experience nicotine deprivation even during sleep. But you won&#8217;t. You will sleep comfortably. After three months your sleep will be normal.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>The danger starts from the third cigarette<br \/>\nBefore quitting smoking completely, Julia Virgin thought that cutting back on cigarettes might not do much harm to health. But his idea was not entirely true. Because, more than two cigarettes are enough to harm health.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Tobias said that smoking between 3 and 20 cigarettes increases the risk of stroke and heart disease. However, cancer is different. In that case, that risk increases with each cigarette. However, one in two smokers die from tobacco addiction. And 50 percent of them died before the age of 70.<\/p>\n<p>Julia said, &#8216;Tobias was sure I would feel the effects of smoking by the time I was 50. But it&#8217;s a huge achievement for me because I can really quit.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>95 percent go back<br \/>\nJulia commented, &#8216;This addiction doctor felt that I didn&#8217;t need nicotine patches, hypnosis or acupuncture as medication to keep cigarettes off my hands. In this case my desire was the key. Even since I started smoking after I turned 21, that was a positive.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Dr Tobias said most smokers start smoking between the ages of 12 and 16. Nicotine is a highly active neurotransmitter, which has a major impact on the development of neural connections in the brain. As a result, it becomes a lifelong addiction, which can rarely be overcome by sheer willpower.<\/p>\n<p>It can be seen that 95% of those who give up their addiction by sheer force of will return to it within the first year of quitting.<\/p>\n<p>A smoker&#8217;s obsession<br \/>\nJulia said, &#8216;One of the reasons for returning to this bad habit after quitting smoking is the attraction or attraction of the smoker. This is a nasty psychological trick by nicotine. The doctor told me that psychological dependence is a strong factor behind cigarette addiction. I checked myself and found that it was. That&#8217;s why I also got addicted to smoking. For years I believed that smoking would calm me down, relieve stress and give me some measure of relief.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>The doctor said, &#8216;The reality is that every cigarette increases your heart rate and makes you more restless.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Pavlov&#8217;s dog<br \/>\nThe first evening without cigarettes was quite strange with music and wine with friends. Nothing, it didn&#8217;t feel right to Julia. &#8220;For years, I&#8217;ve told myself that smoking is only part of certain moments, like with coffee, with wine, or on a break,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;It works like Pavlov&#8217;s dog,&#8217; says Dr Tobias. You gave the dog something to eat and at the same time rang a bell. Sometimes that hour is enough to make a dog salivate.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>For smokers, this bell rings permanently. After work, after eating, while waiting for the bus. The list goes on and on. The bottom line, Tobias said, is that cigarettes become part of smokers&#8217; daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>You want to quit, but how?<br \/>\nIt becomes very difficult for a person who wants to quit smoking addiction. Tobias initially reassures his patients that failure is normal and part of quitting. &#8216;Every time a patient tells me they&#8217;ve tried to quit five times,&#8217; says Tobias. Then I welcome their initiative.&#8217;<br \/>\nThe doctor also said that quitting smoking is like learning to ride a bicycle. Falling is part of it. It is important to sit up.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, something has changed &#8211; this signal must be given to the brain. According to Tobias, &#8216;Sit in a different chair each day in the morning. Drink tea instead of coffee. Change the location of plants in the workplace.&#8217;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;Mom you&#8217;re going to die.&#8221; The number of times my son shook his head in horror when he saw me smoking pales in comparison to the arguments we had for smoking cigarettes.
